Today's task
1)Git is a software which keeps the track of the projects that we have done on our computer whereas GitHub is a webservice where we can do all git things.
2)GitHub is an open source platform where a large number of programmers  can  store ,update there projects based on there versions.
3) version control system means where we can store the project any number of times whenever we commit where we can also access the previous version.git is a distributed version control system which has local repository and can be accessed from anywhere.
4)other platforms are:
  Gitlab,bitbucket,gitbucket,cloud source           repository .....
5)Every month I do a lot of projects where I use to start again from first whenever I got an error so git and GitHub are very helpful to check in which version I am wrong and to continue from my previous version.


Task 2
Q5)Can we leave the commit message as blank?
Ans. Yes, git generally requires a non-empty message because providing a meaningful commit message is part of good development practice and good repository stewardship. The first line of the commit message is used all over the place within git.
